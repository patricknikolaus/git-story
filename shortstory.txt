A purple ball was bouncing down the street. It hopped up onto a curb, and skipped off a wall. It landed in a yard and a dog picked it up. The dogs owner took the ball from the dog and threw it for him. But the dog didn't see where it went and he never found his ball. But he got to go home and chew on his favorite bone.
